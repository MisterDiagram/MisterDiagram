# Gaps

Status: pre-alpha, M0 and M1 met; Phase 2 M2.0 review fixes complete; geometry next.

## G1: Remaining ShapeSheet fidelity

The Phase 1 reader loads all 1387 corpus files; 5548 deterministic mutations produce no panics.
Formula syntax and local/cross-scope evaluation are implemented with bounded errors.
104 function names, master/style/default inheritance and dirty recalc are implemented.
CLI dumps and both numeric corpus oracles are implemented. Full shipped cached accuracy is
97.978884%; resolved accuracy is 98.763183%, with shipped dump coverage 104/1181. Unknown functions,
complete host font IDs and implicit master-child materialization remain open.
Dormant CAD geometry algorithms resume in Phase 2.

Phase 1 acceptance and two independent frozen verification passes are complete. Further
numerical fidelity, complete theme/text hosts and geometry remain later work. Keep the
Phase 2 planning estimate at 70 to 110 hours: renderer, text and theme work has not yet
been measured. Phase 1 took approximately 2.3 wall-clock hours with parallel agents.

## Phase 0 open work

- Visio acceptance resolved in M0.9: normal-process launch and attachment accepted both test files with 9257 cells and zero errors.
- Shipped dump: 104/1181 files complete after four hours; all 1181 files copied (725 stencils, 456 templates). Resume in later background sessions. Charles explicitly excludes this remaining dump coverage from M0 blockers.

## G2: Whole-file info input buffering

Phase 1: info reads the whole compressed file before package checks, within the inherited
deckcraft caps. Review finding N-3 is recorded; no Phase 0 change.

## G3: Closed stderr handling

Resolved in Phase 1 CLI: stderr writes are fallible and their errors are ignored while preserving the failure exit status. Review finding N-4 originally measured exit 1 without panic.

## G4: M1 discovery follow-up (M2.0)

S-1 separates literal, empty and non-literal formulas in both oracle reports. S-2 excludes
No Formula and filters effective inherited formulas, with Charles authorizing a new floor
on that corrected denominator (at least 97%). S-3/S-4 fix explicit inches, master drawing
units and complete COM Connection/Actions rows. S-5 records the document evaluator in L2
vsdx with L1 host interfaces for the upcoming theme/text implementations.
Regression: `basic_rectangle_corpus_has_every_com_identity_and_unit`; all 5748 source rows
have a computed identity and matching units. N-1 compares an empty V with empty Text only.

All five M2.0 closure checks pass. Final strict cached rate 97.595111%; resolved
99.152024%, with non-literal resolved 99.836044%. Read-only shipped coverage 104/1181.

## G5: Rendering (Phase 2)

M2.1 implements all geometry row types in y-up inches, section flags and local/page
transforms. Fifteen kinds have private corpus witnesses; relative Beziers, spline/NURBS
equivalence, clipping and hostile inputs have numerical regressions. The original CAD
editing algorithms remain dormant after their two earlier retarget failures; the active
row converter is new. Fills, lines, themes, text, images and all output formats remain next.

M2.2 paint primitives now cover procedural fill patterns 0..40, gradient stops with alpha,
line patterns 0..23, cap/join/compound bands, straight-corner rounding and arrow kinds 0..45.
Mixed curve/line corner rounding and precise curved-arrow profiles still need render-oracle work;
no visual score is claimed before Step 6. Marker size extrapolation outside corpus sizes
1,2,4 remains unmeasured.
